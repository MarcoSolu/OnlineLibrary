# OnlineLibrary
This project consists in a site where you can find some of books available on [open library](https://openlibrary.org/).
You can see the cover of the book, the title, the author and th description.

# Build
I used these [APIs](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to take data from the server.
I also used webpack to divide the project in modules.

# How to use
Write the books subject you want to search in the search bar and click the button on the right. All the books of the subject category will appear on the page. Here you will find the title and the author. If you click the "More Info" button it will show the description under the button.
